Hello!

I wasn't able to utilize Magic Leap inputs, as there is currently no way to use the simulator with MRTK3—and even MRTK2—anymore. I spent four days trying to set everything up, but as mentioned on the official website,
the simulator only works with MLSDK versions lower than 2.0, whereas MRTK3 and MRTK both require SDK version 2.0 or higher.

So, I’ve used MRTK3 inputs along with XR inputs to meet the objectives.

Inputs:
1. Start the game.
2. In play mode:
    - Use Left Shift for the left hand
    - Use Spacebar for the right hand
    - You can pinch on the Place Model button to spawn a football, which behaves with physics-based movement and falls to the ground.
3. You can grab the football with either hand. Left Mouse Click simulates a pinch gesture.
   - Use C to scale up the football and V to scale it down or use left mouse click with spacebar pressed. 
   - Since the simulator does not support pinch input directly, true grab-interactable scaling via pinch isn’t possible—but this workaround does the job for now. Code does support scaling but only for headsets.
4. Pressing P while holding either Left Shift or Spacebar and aiming the ray downward will spawn an anchor dummy, along with an arrow prefab, to simulate anchor placement and positioning.
5. The canvas is world space meaning the button will follow the camera with some tweaks in the script.

Why didn't I use the XR Simulator (which supports AR plane detection)?
Because MRTK3 Input Simulator was the only way I could simulate hand gestures—albeit to a limited extent. While XR Simulator does support plane detection (a core AR feature), 
it doesn’t support hand gestures. So, I chose the most suitable option and worked around the limitations using a basic plane prefab.

P.S. Play the game in full-screen mode, otherwise the Restart button may not be visible.
I've attached a video demonstration of the work as well 

Thank You!
